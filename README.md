# Machine_Learning_Project

Project objectives

Documentation
- See `docs/xgboost_simple2_explained.md` for a detailed, line-by-line learning guide of the main model (`xgboost_simple2.py`).

The objective of the project is to give students the opportunity to work on real-word dataset. The goal is to apply
different machine learning algorithms and to explore new techniques even though not covered in the course.
The project should allow to students to :
- Apply techniques of data exploration to understand the data set, identify relevant features, ..
- Perform data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical
variables.
- Identify weather the project tackles a problem of clustering or classification
- Apply multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision tree classifier, Random forest classifier, logistic regression,
…)
- Implement and compare different metrics to evaluate the quality of the model
- Clearly present the finding, insights and recommendation
- Compare the results obtained from the different applied methods and discuss the limitation of the models before
presenting areas for future improvement
Project supervision
1. Give students between 4 to 6 weeks to think about and prepare the project..
2. The project should be carried out in groups of 2 or 3.
3. At least one project following up session should be scheduled
4. The marking scheme should be defined at the beginning and communicated to students, as long as it covers the points
listed below
Marking scheme (mandatory part)
- Following up session: evaluate the progress of the different projects
- Evaluate key parts considered as important to be implemented
Marking scheme (optional part
If an optional part is included in the project, it should not exceed 3 pts
